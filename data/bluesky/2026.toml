Currently doing a big rename in a Rust codebase and am reminded that the ability to do this quickly and reliably is not something to be taken for granted.

I remember that even when using TypeScript, the rename facilities of the language server would often fall over in a large codebase.'''

Had a similar experience recently where after not having used TypeScript in anger in a while, it was cool to play around with stuff like ArkType and TanStack Router.

But the fundamental issue for me is that at the end of the day the language just feels too flimsy.'''
